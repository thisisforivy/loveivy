1. Correlation query: find top 10 correlated category_id for a given beacon_id.

select dmp.impression.beacon_id, top10(dmp.data.category_id)
from dmp
where co-reach(dmp.impression.beacon_id,dmp.data.cateory_id) >1000000 AND
reach(dmp.data.category_id)>5000000

The query plan would be

a. scan dmp.data table to find the candidate satify inter-entity-level filter 
reach(dmp.data.category_id)>5000000

b. catesian product of a's result with dmp.impression.beacon_id intra-entity level
and add a Seed (signature) for each row, pipeline to c.

c. group by signature, and apply inter-entity-level filter co-reach(dmp.impression.beacon_id,dmp.data.cateory_id) >1000000 

d. apply top10 aggregate function.
