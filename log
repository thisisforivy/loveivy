This trimester goal is to 
----1.
	- understand catalyst tree framework
	- expression numbering and advanced SQL building block
	- side effect: know more about scala
----2.
	- define edb algebra 
----3.
	- take akka event program class 



04/08/2014	Downloaded and read Scala quick tutorial http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaTutorial.pdf
		Found this useful book http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaByExample.pdf

04/14/2014      Found explaination of self:BaseType with Product =>, it basically means an alias of a specified type, and the 
                class extends this trait must mix in the Product trait. So, case class extends the abstract class, 
                will auto-generate the product interface method. e.g. case class a(x: Int, y: Int); val b = new a(1,2); 
                a.productArity will show 2.
                See good example here http://dcsobral.blogspot.com/2009/06/case-classes-and-product.html
