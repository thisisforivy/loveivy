04/08/2014	Downloaded and read Scala quick tutorial http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaTutorial.pdf
		Found this useful book http://www.scala-lang.org/docu/files/ScalaByExample.pdf

04/14/2014      Found explaination of self:BaseType with Product =>, it basically means an alias of a specified type, and the 
                class extends this trait must mix in the Product trait. So, case class extends the abstract class, 
                will auto-generate the product interface method
                See goog example here http://dcsobral.blogspot.com/2009/06/case-classes-and-product.html
                See http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/8194.html
